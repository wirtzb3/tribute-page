  	<p class="skinny-text">“If Chad would have played abroad anywhere else in the world, he would have been a national-team mainstay. When it’s all said and done, they’re going to name it the Chad Marshall Defender of the Year award. That’s how good he’s been in this league. There’s not one foreign player I’ve come across that hasn’t asked why Chad isn’t a mainstay with the national team. I’ll just leave it at that."</p>
  	<p class="quotemaster">Veteran Striker Herculez Gomez</p>
  	<p class="skinny-text">"Chad is always naked. That’s it. He never has clothes on. That’s what sticks out to me. It’s not even the pranks. It’s just the nakedness and dancing around naked. That’s Chad’s intangible: Naked."</p>
